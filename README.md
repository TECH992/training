## `About name property`

### [name] within square brackets is the computed property name. It means that the property name is not fixed but will be determined by the value of the name variable

### value on the right side of the colon : is the value you want to assign to the property

### For example, `if name has the value "email"`, [name]: `value effectively becomes "email": value.` So, it dynamically sets or updates the property in the object with the name specified by the name variable, and assigns it the value as its value
